                The Time Traveler's Wife is a 2009 American romantic science
                fiction drama film based on Audrey Niffenegger's 2003 novel of
                the same name.[2] Directed by Robert Schwentke, the film stars
                Eric Bana, Rachel McAdams, and Ron Livingston. The story follows
                Henry DeTamble (Bana), a Chicago librarian with a paranormal
                genetic disorder that causes him to randomly time travel as he
                tries to build a romantic relationship with Clare Abshire
                (McAdams), whom he meets as a child and who later becomes his
                wife.
