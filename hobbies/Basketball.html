              <p>
                Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of
                five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
                compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
                (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the
                defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted
                10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court),
                while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their
                own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from
                behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a
                foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to
                shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free
                throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game
                wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an
                additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
