        Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an
        early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they
        were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic
        experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They
        became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as
        the greatest progressive rock band of all time.

        Slipknot is an American heavy metal band formed in Des Moines, Iowa, in
        1995 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist
        Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band
        settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray,
        Craig Jones, Mick Thomson, Corey Taylor, Sid Wilson, Chris Fehn, and Jim
        Root. Bassist Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during
        2011â€“2014 by Donnie Steele. Jordison was dismissed from the band on
        December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for .5: The
        Gray Chapter. The band found replacements in Alessandro Venturella on
        bass and Jay Weinberg on drums. After the departure of Jordison, as of
        December 2013 the only founding member in the current lineup is
        percussionist Crahan. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March
        2019 prior to the writing of We Are Not Your Kind and was replaced by
        Michael Pfaff. The band parted ways with Jones in 2023.
